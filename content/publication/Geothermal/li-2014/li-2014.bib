 abstract = {© 2014 by the authors. Enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) extract heat from underground hot dry rock (HDR) by first fracturing the HDR and then circulating a geofluid (typically water) into it and bringing the heated geofluid to a power plant to generate electricity. This study focuses on analysis, examination, and comparison of leading geothermal power plant configurations with a geofluid temperature from 200 to 800 °C, and also analyzes the embodied energy of EGS surface power plants. The power generation analysis is focused on flash type cycles for using subcritical geofluid (\textless374 °C) and expansion type cycles for using supercritical geofluid (\textgreater374 °C). Key findings of this study include: (i) double-flash plants have 24.3%-29.0% higher geofluid effectiveness than single-flash ones, and 3%-10% lower specific embodied energy; (ii) the expansion type plants have geofluid effectiveness \textgreater 750 kJ/kg, significantly higher than flash type plants (geofluid effectiveness \textless 300 kJ/kg) and the specific embodied energy is lower; (iii) to increase the turbine outlet vapor fraction from 0.75 to 0.90, we include superheating by geofluid but that reduces the geofluid effectiveness by 28.3%; (iv) for geofluid temperatures above 650 °C, double-expansion plants have a 2% higher geofluid effectiveness and 5%-8% lower specific embodied energy than single-expansion ones.},
