abstract: "Telemetry sampling rates from enterprise servers and for IoT asset prognostic monitoring are often
constrained by hardware limitations in physical transducers and A/D digitizing firmware, and by hardcoded
firmware in data acquisition instrumentation. The sampling restrictions impose challenges in terms of
training advanced pattern recognition for prognostic applications such as Prognostic Cyber Security in
enterprise and cloud data centers, and prognostic health management for end-customer IoT critical assets. No
matter how slow the inherent sampling rate capabilities are for monitored assets, this paper introduces a novel
empirical systematic and rigorous process to produce arbitrarily high telemetry sampling densities from assets
for which such high telemetry sampling densities are physically and electronically impossible. This capability
is achieved with no hardware or firmware modifications in any of the critical assets being monitored, and hence
is backward compatible with legacy assets already in operation."
