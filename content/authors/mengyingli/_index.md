Iâ€™m an Assistant Professor in the department of [Mechniacal Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic Univeristy](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). Prior to join PolyU in 2020, I worked as a Postdoctoral Scholar from 2018 to 2020 in [Center for Energy Research](https://cer.ucsd.edu/) at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My postdocoral work and Ph.D. dissertation research was advised by [Prof. Carlos F. M. Coimbra](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=324). I conducted various research projects such as high-fidelity solar irradiance forecasting using physical and machine learning models; spectral modeling of longwave and shortwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere; and physics-based estimation of cloud optical properties from cutting-edge remote sensing data (e.g., GOES satellite imaging).  Currently, my research areas are expanded to large-scale thermal energy storage, hybridizing different renewable sources for power production, passive cooling and desalination.
