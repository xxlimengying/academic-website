I’m a PhD student in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/). 
Prior to joining Dr. Li's research group in 2021, I was a Master Student in [InnoEnergy Master's School](https://www.innoenergy.com/for-students-learners/master-school/). 
I did my master thesis in [PSI Swizterland](https://www.psi.ch/en), which was about applying machine learning in life cycle assessment of wind energy systems.
