Welcome to the Renewable Energy Advancement Lab (REALab) lead by [Dr. Mengying Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/li-mengying/) in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/). 

As the global population will continue to grow in the following decades, solutions to extract food, energy and clean water from the Earthâ€™s limited resources and land area are essential and challenging. The solutions also must aim at mitigating climate change and reducing pollution. In REALab, we are dedicated to develop system-wise technologies for renewable energy utilizations to decarbonize the power grid. To improve solar power integration, we develop spectral modeling of longwave and shortwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere; and physics-based estimation of cloud optical properties from cutting-edge remote sensing data (e.g., GOES satellite imaging).  To further improve the grid peneration of renewable power, we research on novel large-scale thermal energy storage, hybridization of different renewable sources for power production and solar-driven passive cooling and desalination.
