Welcome to the Renewable Energy Advancement Lab (REALab) lead by [Dr. Mengying Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/li-mengying-dr/) in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/). 

Extracting food, energy and clean water from the Earthâ€™s limited resources and land area while mitigating climate change and reducing pollution is essential but challenging. In REALab, we are dedicated to explore the science and develop technologies to utilize renewable energy efficiently. To improve solar power integration, we develop high fidelity solar power forecasting models by integrating spectral atmospheric radiative transfer, physics-based estimation of cloud optical properties from cutting-edge remote sensing data (e.g., GOES satellite imaging) and machine learning techniques.  To improve the grid penetration of renewable power, we research novel large-scale thermal and chemical energy storage, hybridization of different renewable sources for power production and solar-driven passive cooling and desalination.
