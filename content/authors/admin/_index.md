Iâ€™m a Postdoctoral Scholar studying Renewable Energy and Energy Meteorology in the [Center for Energy Research](https://cer.ucsd.edu/) at [University of California San Diego](https://ucsd.edu/). My postdocoral work and PhD dissertation research was advised by [Prof. Carlos F. M. Coimbra](http://jacobsschool.ucsd.edu/faculty/faculty_bios/index.sfe?fmp_recid=324), and was funded by projects from [National Science Foundation](https://www.nsf.gov/), [Department of Energy](https://www.energy.gov/) and [California Energy Comission](https://www.energy.ca.gov/) and Department of Energy. During my time with the [Coimbra Research Group](http://coimbra.ucsd.edu/), I was involved with a number of research projects such as high-fidelity solar irradiance forecasting using physical and machine learning models; spectral modeling of longwave and shortwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere; and physics-based estimation of cloud optical properties from cutting-edge remote sensing data (e.g., GOES satellite imaging).  Currently, I am expanding my research areas to large-scale thermal energy storage, hybridizing different renewable sources for power production, passive cooling and desalination.
