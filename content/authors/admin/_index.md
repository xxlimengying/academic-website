Welcome to the Renewable Energy Advancement Lab (REALab) lead by [Dr. Mengying Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/li-mengying/) in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at the [Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/). We are dedicated to develop models and systems that improve the efficiency of renewable energy utilizations. For solar power integration, we develop spectral modeling of longwave and shortwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere; and physics-based estimation of cloud optical properties from cutting-edge remote sensing data (e.g., GOES satellite imaging).  To further improve the grid peneration of renewable power, we research on novel large-scale thermal energy storage, hybridization of different renewable sources for power production and solar-driven passive cooling and desalination.
