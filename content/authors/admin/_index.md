Welcome to the Renewable Energy Advancement Lab (REALab) lead by [Dr. Mengying Li](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/people/academic-teaching-staff/li-mengying/) in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/me/) at [The Hong Kong Polytechnic University](https://www.polyu.edu.hk/en/). 

Extracting food, energy and clean water from the Earthâ€™s limited resources and land area while mitigating climate change and reducing pollution are essential but challenging. In REALab, we are dedicated to explore the science and develop technologies to utilize renewable energy efficiently. To improve solar power integration, we develop spectral modeling of longwave and shortwave radiative transfer in the atmosphere, and physics-based estimation of cloud optical properties from cutting-edge remote sensing data (e.g., GOES satellite imaging).  To improve the grid peneration of renewable power, we research on novel large-scale thermal energy storage, hybridization of different renewable sources for power production and solar-driven passive cooling and desalination.
