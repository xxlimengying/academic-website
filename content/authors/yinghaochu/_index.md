Iâ€™m an Associate Research Scientist in the [College of Electronics and Information Engineering](http://ceie.szu.edu.cn/szucie/) at [Shenzhen University](https://www.szu.edu.cn/).  Prior to join Shenzhen University in 2020, I was a co-founder and AI scientist of [Aiator Inc.](http://www.aiator.com/), where I developed the core technologies focusing on AI - enhanced robots for various applications, developed and deployed deep learning based algorithm for 16 commercial projects, including financial projects such quantitative evaluations of investment strategy and risk control analysis for P2P individuals.  My current research involves the integration of various Machine Learning algorithms with renewable power forecasting for grid integration. Such algorithms include but not limited to Asymmetric Siamese Network, Generative Adversarial Networks, YOLO v4, Unet3+ and CNN+RNN(resnet+lstm).
